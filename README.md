# RadTechZombieLand
A gamemode addon for RadTech Zombies

Simulate a "Day of the Dead" scenario by replacing 
gun-toting zombies with the flesh-eating kind. Also
replaces projectile throwing demons with melee types,
like babuins, ninja pirates, and lost souls.

Must be loaded after RadTech Zombies.
