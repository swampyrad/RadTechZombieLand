# RadTechZombieLand
A gamemode addon for RadTech Zombies

Simulate a "Day of the Dead" scenario by replacing 
gun-toting zombies with the flesh-eating kind. 
Turns all non-boss enemies (Cyberdemons, Barons of 
Hell, and Spider Masterminds) into Melee Zombies.
Babuin/Ninja Pirate spawns are untouched, they act
as a "zombie dog" enemy type for added variety.

Must be loaded after RadTech Zombies.
